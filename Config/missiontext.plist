NAME: Norby-Ramen Quirium Accuracy Drive\n
DETAILS: The Q.A.D works by chaining together what amounts to faster witchspace jumps from station to station, using accuracy drives, which make the jumps incredibly accurate, but also require station-level generators and capacitors. Which is why this wonderful piece of equipment is not available on ships. Because stations carry a large amount of fuel, this is viable. However, an incredibly large amount of fuel is required, thus the high fee to use the Norby-Ramen Quirium Accuracy Drive, or colloquially, the Hyperspace Hangar. It is worth noting that only the drive is actually required. There is no actual difference between the station hangar and the Hyperspace Hangar. However, only a station with publicly availible fuel supplies and a shipyard will mount a Q.A.D, for obvious reasons. If using a TL 6 or lower Q.A.D., be aware that these are unlicensed. They are not illegal, but have high chance of damaging your ship, about 7/8. The hangar service is monitored by Norby-Ramen Equipment Industries, in partnership with Lone Wolf industries.\n\nINFORMATION PAST THIS POINT REQUIRES AUTHORIZATION FOR THE LOCAL GALCOP AUTORITIES. ACCESS WILL BE DENIED UNTIL AUTHORIZED.";

The Quirium Accuracy Drive was initially developed by an employee working at a ramen stand in the Lezaer system of Galaxy 2. The corporation has since moved to Galaxy 6, though it maintains branches in all GalCop regions. Many are intially surprised to learn that the drive is the result of original work, and has nothing to do with the Thargoids or their technology. The Ramen Corporation is currently working with GalCop scientists to develop a version that is small and efficient enough to fit on a military ship, in order to combat the Thargoids. While there has been significant progress in this research, the Ramen Corporation has no plans for a commercial version at this time, due to the extensive ship requirements needed to use the drive.";
